            Updated labelmask matching shape of labelmask
    
    This is an imperfect solution to applying morphological operations to 
    labelmasks, so one needs to be a bit careful. The basic strategy is to
    binarize the mask, perform operations on it, and then from that mask 
    look up labels in the previous mask. This is better than re-labeling 
    because it allows the operations to produce objects that touch without 
    merging them. The issue is looking up the labels, which seems to be non-
    trivial. 
    
    The solution here is to generate a "lookup mask" by applying a maximum 
    filter (size determined by expand_size) to the labelmask, which expands 
    each object into its local area. As long as resulting morphological 
    operations keep the object within this area, they'll get the proper label. 
    As long as objects in the original image are spaced farther than the 
    supplied sizes in the three dimensions, this will work perfectly well. If 
    this isn't true, the object with the numerically larger label (arbitrary) 
    will expand at the expense of its neighbor. Of note, this maximum filter is 
    mathematially identical to morpholocial dilation when their is non conflict 
    between objects.
    
    For labelmasks with well-spaced objects, the function works as expected. 
    For closely spaced objects, one needs to select an expand_size that will
    generally be less than or equal to the object separation. For most
    applications, conflicts at edges won't be of great consequence but should
    be kept in mind.
    
    Suggested settings:
    
        -For operations that reduce the size of objects, leave expand_size 
        at (1,1,1), as resulting objects will be entirely contained within
        original objects.
        
        -For operations that increase the size of objects, set expand_size 
        to be equal to or slightly greater than expected increases in object
        size, and no more than the typical separation between objects.
