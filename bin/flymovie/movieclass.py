class movie():
    """
    A class to store data (processed and unprocessed) for confocal movies
    from fly embryos.

    Style note: movie should be capitalized, but I did not know this style
    convention when I made it and I am leaving it for compatability reasons

    Attributes:
        stack: ndarray
            N-dimensional image stack of the original data.
        nucmask: ndarray
            Labelmask of segmented nuclei
        fits: list of ndarrays
            3D gaussian fits generated in MS2 spot detection as output of 
            function fit_ms2. Each entry in the list is a time point (frame). 
            Each row in array is a fit (a single local maxima), columns are: 
            0: center z-coordinate, 1: center x-coordinate, 2: center 
            y-coordinate, 3: fit_height, 4: width_z, 5: width_x, 6: width_y). 
            Coordinates are adjusted so that if fit center lies outside the 
            image, center is moved to the edge.
        spot_data: dict of ndarrays
            Each key is a unique spot tracked across 1 or more frames. Each row
            of array is the spot's data for a single frame, with columns 0: frame
            number (t), 1: nucleus ID, 2: center Z-coordinate, 3: center X-coord-
            inate, 4: center Y-coordinate, 5: fit height, 6: fit z_width, 7: fit
            x_width, 8: fit y_width, 9: integrated volume for MS2, 10: integrated
            gaussian fit of MS2 spots, 11: integrated volume for protein signal.
        intvol: pandas df
            Intensity values for spots (over time) derived from the mean signal
            within ellipsoid volumes around detected spot centers.
        intfit: pandas df
            Intensity values for spots (over time) derived from integrating the 
            fitted 3D gaussian parameters.
        prot: pandas df
            Equivalent to intvol except integrations performed in the protein
            (nuclear) channel
