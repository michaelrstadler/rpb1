    There are two modes which differ in how they find candidate ms2 spots
    for fitting. In 'mindist' mode, the filtered image is searched for local
    maxima separated by a supplied minimum distance. This can create errors
    when spots happen to occur at extreme nuclear edges very near each other
    (passing within minimum distance). In 'nucleus' mode, a maximum pixel 
    is found for each nucleus in each frame and fitted. This mode is 
    generally better as long as the supplied nuclear mask is good.
