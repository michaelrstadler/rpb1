    "    - top N accuracy: how often is the most-similar non-self image in the top N\n",
    "    - Mean ranking of top N: rank images by actual similarity (based on sim parameters), rank them by embedding distance, compare. I think I'll start with just the sum of the squared rank differences. I can probably adapt this to be something with useful statistical properties eventually but no need right now.\n"
