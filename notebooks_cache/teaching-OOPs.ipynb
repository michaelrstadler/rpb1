Remember from looking at our old friend the humble __list__, Python objects don't just store data but can also do stuff like—for lists—append and sort.

    "By putting __GoodBoy__ in the parentheses in the class construction statement, we told Python that __Floofter__ is a child of the parent class __GoodBoy__. This means that any __Floofter__ we create will have all the attributes and methods that we already made for __GoodBoy__, without us having to copy a single line of code! As we can see above, *__shea__* can still do all the GoodBoy things (initialize, introduce), but Python now says *__shea__*'s type is __Floofter__.\n",

    "Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another. Newly formed classes are called *child classes*, and the classes that child classes are derived from are called *parent classes*. The child class inherits all of the functionality (attributes and methods) of its parent classes, and in the case of any conflicts, the *child class wins*: Changes in the child class override anything in the parent class. The new child class extends or overrides functionality of the parent class. This is incredibly powerful, as it means that instead of having to rewrite a class every time we want to add or remove or change a little bit, we can just create a child class and make the changes to it, preserving everything we already created in the parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play with __Floofter__ to give it some new functionality. Notice we didn't give our new class an __\\_\\_init\\_\\___ method. Python is smart, and will search \"up the chain\" of and object's parentage until it finds one. In this case, it (correctly) used the __\\_\\_init\\_\\___ method from __GoodBoy__. Let's make a new __\\_\\_init\\_\\___ just for __Floofter__ that will override the parent method. All that floof means we might be more interested in coat properties, so let's add some of those to our initialization. Our furry friends will probably want to tell people about their floof, so we will also add a method to help them with that:"

    "__super()__ creates a temporary instance of the parent object, giving you access to all of its functionality (including overriden parts!) from inside the child class.

The advantages of __super()__ are that its a bit more elegant (whatever that means) and that when you get into more complicated patterns of inheritance, it can be advantageous not to explicitly name the parent but rather to generaically call \"whatever the parent is\". That's pretty advanced stuff though, so for now let's just say using __super()__ to call parent functions from within a child object is nifty and Pythonic and will make you look like you know what you're doing!

    "So why do we need classes? Do we need classes? The answer is probably no: object-oriented programming is just a style. Put another way: OOP isn't for computers—it's for humans. The computer is ultimately getting the same instructions whether you write it in an object-oriented or procedural (or any other) style. OOP exists for the people who write and read code as a useful way to organize and understand programs.\n",

    "So what are the advantages of classes? When you read intros to OOP, you they always emphasize that it makes programming match the way you look at the world already. We have a concept of what a “car” is, and within that car we know what a 1995 Toyota Celica is, and we know that Stad’s busted-ass-because-he’s-a-forever-postdoc 1995 Toyota Celica is a specific instance of that kind of car. So object-oriented approaches match programming abstraction to human abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s probably true, but honestly I always roll my eyes a little. I mean, high level languages are already pretty abstracted and human-readable, and it's not that hard to think in lists and dataframes. For my (admittedly limited) usage I have found the main advantage of classes to be that it’s simply a convenient way to group code and data when programming. I constantly end up with related things in my code. For example, for a single confocal movie, I have a bunch of data: the image stack itself, information about the experiment (date, fly line, microscope, labeled gene, developmental stage…), information extracted from the movie (nuclear mask, MS2 spot mask, intensity profiles of spots). I also have a bunch of functions that I wrote to work on these data (nuclei segmenter, MS2 spot segmenter, normalization functions…). There are lots of ways I could organize this code, but a very convenient way to do so is to create a __Movie__ class and populate movie objects with all the things I need.\n",
