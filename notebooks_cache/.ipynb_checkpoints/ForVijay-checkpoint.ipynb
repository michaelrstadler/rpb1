    "# MS2 processing\n",
    "\n",
    "This is work in progress, so it's not really set up for others to use and descriptions are weak. The input data is 2-channel fluorescence microscopy movies of fly embryos. In one channel is a nuclear-protein (which marks nuclei and is also interesting in its own right), and in the other channel are \"MS2\" spots, which are individual transcribed genes. The intensity of the spot corresponds to how actively the gene is being transcribed. The resulting data give us a real time readout of gene transcription. The computational challenge is to segment nuclei, detect MS2 spots, and quantify the fluorescence intensity of those spots. I also do some correcting of those measurements (for bleaching and sample depth), but I'm working on those and they're not quite ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote everything with the idea of being used in an interactive notebook. The reason is that the data are not (yet) standardized. I potentially want to analyze data with different resolutions, fields of view, nuclear sizes (a function of the developmental stage of the embryo), nuclear proteins (which protein is fluorescently labeled), laser intensities (influencing signal intensity and contrast), and other variables. As such it isn't currently set up to be a single command-line pipeline where you input files and it spits out processed data. I expect the user to tweak parameters at various steps to get it to work for a given dataset. Eventually, some of these experiments might get standardized to that point, and alternately good enough code could probably work that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on speed: This dataset processes pretty quickly because 1) it's a small dataset and 2) I've sped things up by working in 2D where possible, particularly with the nuclear segmentation. This is workable, but it would be better to do proper 3D segmentation. It's just that with larger datasets, 3D segmentation takes a long time. Parallelizing parts to speed this up would be very nice...\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook calls functions from the imagep.py file (located in bin/), and imagep.py requires the file fitting.py (also in bin) to be in the same directory. The dependencies are also probably going to be hell -- it seems that for anyone else to use, putting it in a docker container would be helpful. Anyway, this is its current state.\n",

    "There are 5 files (consecutive movies -- we periodically re-adjust the Z position to account for drift), but you don't need to do all 5. The first 2 will suffice."
